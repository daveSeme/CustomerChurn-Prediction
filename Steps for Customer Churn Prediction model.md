In order to Predict customer Churn, I used the following steps;
# Understanding the Problem
To predict customer churn for Sprint based on historical data and customer attributes i needed to undersatnd the task at hand and have an idea of what i need to look for.I used dataset from Kaggle
# Data Preprocessing:
Handling Missing Values: Checked for missing values and filled or dropped them accordingly.
Converting Data Types: Ensured appropriate data types for analysis (e.g., converting TotalCharges to numeric).
Handling Non-Numeric Data: Encoded categorical features into numerical values.
Feature Scaling: Scaled features to ensure they have similar importance in the model.
# Model Selection and Training:
Selected the Random Forest classifier, a popular model for classification tasks.
Split the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
Trained the Random Forest model using the training data.
# Model Evaluation:
Evaluation Metrics: Calculated accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report for model evaluation.
Interpreted Metrics: Analyzed precision, recall, and F1-score for predicting customer churn.
# Feature Importance Analysis:
I derived feature importances from the trained Random Forest model.
Identified the most influential features in predicting customer churn.
# Interpretation and Insights:
Analyzed the feature importances to understand which factors significantly affect churn predictions.
Provided insights on how Sprint can use this information to reduce churn and improve customer retention.
